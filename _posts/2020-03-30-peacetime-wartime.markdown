I’ve heard “peacetime” and “wartime” language over the last weeks — contrasting how we should lead, how companies should strategize and what spirit we should adopt as a government during this pandemic. 

I understand the connotation and [analogy for CEO’s](https://a16z.com/2011/04/14/peacetime-ceowartime-ceo-2/),  but it wasn’t until I was asked to help with some communication that used this language that I appreciated some of the pitfalls of the analogy.

**The analogy can be useful:**

_It communicates “things are different”._ There is stark contrast between “now” and “then”. This forces rethinking how you operate now.

_It communicates urgency and focus._ In a crisis, you need to move quickly. People are anxious and resistant to change. Wartime leadership demands crystal clear focus on the mission. The analogy is stirring. 

_It offers shared language._ “That idea works great in peacetime, but not now” or “She is a wartime leader”.

**However, the analogy can be unhelpful:**

_Unclear, triumphalist mental models._ “We are brilliant, strategic commanders”. When the analogy is overcooked, you can misstep.

_Implies a passing season._ For some, use of the phrase has implied that “things will get back to normal", which may be stopping them making the big moves necessary to survive or grow.
