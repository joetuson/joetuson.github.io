There is a common misnomer that coaching is for underperformers.

The opposite is true. 

Underperformers need training or firing. Coaching works best for high performers, who’ve reached the peak of their technical skill and recognize that alone isn’t enough to succeed.

Coaching is helping you grow and improve, through awareness, challenge and support.

There are many obstacles to growth: personal and interpersonal struggle, lack of awareness, lack of self belief, anxiety, imposter syndrome, overconfidence, to name a few.

Frankly, there is a lot of weird stuff in the coaching world that puts people off — particularly driven, cerebral, type A founders. The weird stuff puts me off too.

[My background](/about) is engineering leadership in startups and public companies. I appreciate deadlines, runway, launch pressure, being data driven.

But many go too far and ignore emotional health, or think it’s nice-to-have. This is ill informed. Emotionally unhealthy leaders kill companies — through poor decisions, inadequate team building, or their inability to hire and retain talent.

My appreciation for rationale and logic combined with my emphasis on self awareness and emotional health is what makes me unique as a coach. 

A good coach will increase your awareness, ask challenging questions, offer you support to help you be successful and find meaning.
