There is a common misnomer that coaching is for underperformers.

The opposite is true. 

Underperformers need training or firing. Coaching works best for high performers, who’ve reached the peak of their technical skill and recognize that alone isn’t enough to succeed. 

Thankfully, the culture is changing, but leaders frequently realize they need help too late — after a failed startup, attrition or burnout.

Coaching is about helping you grow and improve. 

We all have blindspots and there are many obstacles to growth: personal and interpersonal struggle, lack of awareness, lack of self belief, anxiety, imposter syndrome, to name a few.

[My background](/about) is engineering and leadership in startups and public companies. I understand deadlines, runway, launch pressure, being data driven.

However, this isn't the whole picture. Many go too far and ignore emotional health, or think it’s nice-to-have. This is ill informed. Emotionally unhealthy leaders kill companies — through poor decisions, inadequate team building, or their inability to hire and retain talent.

My coaching combines rationale and logic with an emphasis on self awareness and emotional health.

It looks like listening deeply, asking challenging questions, supporting you, encouraging you when you need it, brainstorming, and raising awareness of your blindspots.

I've worked with leaders at Facebook, Slack, Netflix, Oracle and several Venture capital firms and startups.
